## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Ghostplayer store page (https://payhip.com/Ghostplayer)

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "My project a web-based synthesizer.")

My project is updating the look of my payhip site to sell digital products including sample packs and Serum presets.

## List at least 3 resources you know you will use in developing your project

html/css webpage development

Accessing video from an external source (api?)

Payhip's store builder

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My project will involve learning how to use html or css in conjunction with Payhip's store builder to add background video, and possibly animated text and images to my store page. I have an extremely basic store set up currently, with a solid color background that I hope to replace with a full-page looping video. I also hope to learn enough to be able to customize more of the website, and make it look more professional.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

GOOD outcome: I will add a looping video to the background of my website, and use Payhip's editor to add some polish to the rest of the site (consistent colors, text, etc.)

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

BETTER outcome: In addition to those features, I will learn some other ways to implement html/css code in other places in the website, such as the header or product pages. For example, button animations, embedded video, or any kind of interactive elements.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

BEST outcome: I will design a fully polished store page, with dynamic screen elements including background, text and links. I will be able to customize all colors and pages to be fully consistent and visually pleasing.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps WITH A SPECIFIC CALENDAR. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?
