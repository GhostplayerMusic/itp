# Phase 1

I drew some more ideas with basic shapes. The one with the triangles I decided would be too complicated to actually fit them inside each other, since I would have to calculate the midpoint and didn't feel like looking up the formula.

I decided to do deadmau5, and figured out a ratio of having the main head be a 3 diameter circle, and the ears be 2 diameter. For the semicircle I will be using Processing's "arc" function which can easily be used to draw semicircles. I will also have to make the eyes and mouth a different color from the rest of the 'head.'
