# Phase 3

This one I had a little bit of trouble with, but it was solved after I realized that I was trying to call my defined drawObject function with out the syntax of "def draw()" before the function call.

Setting up the acutal function was very simple, and things worked once I figured out how to correctly call the function in Processing.
